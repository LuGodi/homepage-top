# What is this

Fully responsive layout making use of media queries and flex/grid

Practicing with responsive images

### Known bugs:

- if font-size changes (goes over 25px) on a device width of 300px ish it causes some weird overflows. Gotta check if its like that on more devices, probably caused by relative margins and paddings.

- DONE - I can lessen the number of media queries by making use of more advanced grid/flex properties, working on this

- Can add more accessibility
